\title{Grid search for optimal K in unmixing models}
\usage{
k_optimize(
  data_list,
  data_types,
  K_seq,
  reps = 8,
  max_iter = 1000,
  tol = 1e-08,
  seeds = NULL,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{Named list of matrices (samples × features) passed to `unmix()`.}

\item{data_types}{Named character vector indicating type of each dataset:
`"continuous"`, `"compositional"`, or `"clr"`.}

\item{K_seq}{Integer vector of K values to test.}

\item{reps}{Number of replicate runs per K (different seeds).}

\item{max_iter}{Maximum iterations passed to `unmix()`.}

\item{tol}{Convergence tolerance passed to `unmix()`.}

\item{seeds}{Optional integer vector of length = `reps`. Defaults to `1:reps`.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A tibble with one row per run containing:
  K, replicate number, seed, loss, iterations, convergence flag,
  number of samples, and dimensions of each block (as JSON).
}
\description{
Runs `unmix()` for a sequence of K values and multiple random seeds,
summarizing model fit statistics (loss, AIC, BIC). Intended for both
interactive exploration (e.g., in Shiny) and scripted benchmarking.
